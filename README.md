# SmartClockTimerNtp
ESP based clock designed to integrate with Home Assistant, for displaying timer status through RGB strip

The plan is to use a cheap ESP-01 to run a 60 led string of Dotstars on the back of an analog clock. when a timer is running on Home assistant, it should be able 
to pull the status of the timer(s) and display them using a different color for each timer.
